# Final Project Proposal

  For my final project, I want to recreate the game [Dig Dug](https://www.arcadeclassics.net/80s-game-videos/dig-dug).  This is an arcade game where there is a player who digs around and takes out enemies for points while avoiding being killed by enemies.  The levels get harder as the player finishes more levels.  I want to do this project because I have played the game before so I a familiar with the rules, and it is a cool project where I can show a lot of skills that I learned this semester.
  
  By the end of week one, I will have finished the functionality to generate the starting game state for every level.  This game state will get harder every level with more enemies being spawned at the start.  I will also have added player and enemy movement.  By the end of week 2, I will have finished the algorithm for the enemies to move towards the player and added functionality for the player to kill enemies and for enemies to kill the player.  By the end of week 3, I will have connected the backend functionality to the frontend cinder application by creating the images of the player, enemies, and blocks.  I will display these images to the screen as well as change the board according to player movement.  On the game page, I will include the score and lives.
  
  If I were to finish the project early, I could add some stretch goals that would add depth to my project.  I could add more types of enemies that have different abilities.  I could also add more details to my UI that make the gameboard more realistic.
