# Dig Dug Recreation

### Summary

This game is a recreation of Dig Dug, a retro game where you dig around the map attacking enemies.  Taking out all the enemies on the board will take you to the next level, and the difficulty increases as level increases.  Taking out an enemy gives you 100 points, and advancing a level gives you 200 points.  The goal of the game is to take out as many enemies as possible to maximize your score using the 3 lives given to you.  When the player is attacked by the enemy, the level restarts and all the killed enemies are respawned.
